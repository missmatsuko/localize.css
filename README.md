# localize.css
Collection of CSS styles useful for localizing web content.

Currently I'm just collecting styles for different languages as a reference, excluding any resetting styles.

Eventually this may become a CSS library.

Contributions are very welcome, especially from people who are fluent in languages other than English!

Take a look at #5 for places to start.
